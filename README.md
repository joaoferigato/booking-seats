# About

Angular 9 front-end project to book seats. At that time, I was using a platform which was not compatible with ES6 and did not have some basic JS array methods (e.g.: filter()), that is why they were not used in the project.
The HTML rendered changes depeneding on how many rows are selected, default is 18 | 20 | 18.
